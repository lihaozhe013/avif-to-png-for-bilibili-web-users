for bilibili web users, some downloaded images from comment section are avif, which is not commonly used. 
So I created such tool using the c language, which is easy to be run on all kinds of systems, whatever linux desktop, windows or macos.
there's no ui of the 1.0 version of my program, so just make sure your input image is "input.avif", and then you will get a "output.png" file.
